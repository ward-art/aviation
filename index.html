      The Airbus A380 is a large wide-body airliner that was developed and
      produced by Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner and only
      full-length double-deck jet airliner. Airbus studies started in 1988, and
      the project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing
      747 in the long-haul market. The then-designated A3XX project was
      presented in 1994; Airbus launched the €9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) A380
      programme on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in
      Toulouse on 18 January 2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. It
      then obtained its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety
      Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 12
      December 2006. Due to difficulties with the electrical wiring, the initial
      production was delayed by two years and the development costs almost
      doubled. It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007
      and entered service on 25 October. Production peaked at 30 per year in
      2012 and 2014. <br />However, after the largest customer, Emirates,
      reduced its last order in February 2019, Airbus announced that A380
      production would end in 2021. On 16 December 2021, Emirates received its
      123rd A380, which was the 251st and last delivered by Airbus. The $25
      billion investment was not recouped. The full-length double-deck aircraft
      has a typical seating for 525 passengers, with a maximum certified
      capacity for 853 passengers. The quadjet is powered by Engine Alliance
      GP7200 or Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans providing a range of 8,000 nmi
      (14,800 km). As of December 2021, the global A380 fleet had completed more
      than 800,000 flights over 7.3 million block hours with no fatalities and
      no hull losses. As of June 2022, there were 239 aircraft in service with
      16 operators worldwide.

      Developed from Airbus A320ceo family The Airbus A320neo family is a
      development of the A320 family of narrow-body airliners produced by
      Airbus. The A320neo family (neo for "new engine option") is based on the
      previous A319, A320 and A321 (enhanced variant), which was then renamed
      A320ceo, for "current engine option". Re-engined with CFM LEAP-1A or Pratt
      & Whitney PW1000G engines and fitted with sharklets as standard, it is 15%
      to 20% more fuel efficient than the A320ceo (Enhanced) family. It was
      launched on 1 December 2010, made its first flight on 25 September 2014
      and was introduced by Lufthansa on 25 January 2016. By 2019, the A320neo
      had a 60% market share against the competing Boeing 737 MAX.[4] As of July
      2022, a total of 8,502 A320neo family aircraft had been ordered by more
      than 130 customers, of which 2,341 aircraft had been delivered. The global
      A320neo fleet had completed more than 5.51 million flights over 11 million
      block hours without accidents

      In 2006 Airbus started the A320 Enhanced (A320E) programme as a series of
      improvements targeting a 4–5% efficiency gain with large winglets (2%),
      aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin. At
      the time Airbus' Sales Chief John Leahy said "Who's going to roll over a
      fleet to a new generation aircraft for 5% better than an A320 today?
      Especially if another 10% improvement might be coming in the second half
      of the next decade based on new engine technology".[5] Airbus launched the
      sharklet blended wingtip device during the November 2009 Dubai Airshow.
      The installation adds 200 kilograms (440 lb) but offers a 3.5% fuel burn
      reduction on flights over 2,800 km (1,500 nmi

      William Edward Boeing (/boʊŋ/; October 1, 1881 September 28, 1956) was an
      American aviation pioneer who founded the Pacific Airplane Company in
      1916, which a year later was renamed to The Boeing Company, now the
      largest exporter in the United States by dollar value and among the
      largest aerospace manufacturers in the world. William Boeing's first
      design was the Boeing Model 1 (or B & W Seaplane), which first flew in
      June 1916, a month before the company was founded. He also helped create
      the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (known as "United Airlines"
      today) in 1929 and served as its chairman. He received the Daniel
      Guggenheim Medal in 1934 and was posthumously inducted in to the National
      Aviation Hall of Fame in 1966, ten years after his death

      The Boeing 747-400 is a large, long-range wide-body airliner produced by
      Boeing Commercial Airplanes, an advanced variant of the initial Boeing
      747. The "Advanced Series 300" was announced at the September 1984
      Farnborough Airshow, targeting a 10% cost reduction with more efficient
      engines and 1,000 nautical miles (1,900 km) of additional range. Northwest
      Airlines (NWA) became the first customer with an order for 10 aircraft on
      October 22, 1985. The first 747-400 was rolled out on January 26, 1988,
      and made its maiden flight on April 29, 1988. Type certification was
      received on January 9, 1989, and it entered service with NWA on February
      9, 1989. It retains the 747 airframe, including the 747-300 stretched
      upper deck, with 6 ft (1.8 m) winglets. The 747-400 offers a choice of
      improved turbofans: the Pratt & Whitney PW4000, General Electric CF6-80C2
      or Rolls-Royce RB211-524G/H. Its two-crew glass cockpit dispenses with the
      need for a flight engineer. It typically accommodates 416 passengers in a
      three-class layout over a 7,285 nmi (13,492 km) range with its
      875,000-pound (397 t) maximum takeoff weight (MTOW). The first -400M combi
      was rolled out in June 1989. The -400D Domestic for the Japanese market,
      without winglets, entered service on October 22, 1991. The -400F cargo
      variant, without the stretched upper deck, was first delivered in May
      1993. With an increased MTOW of 910,000 lb (410 t), the extended range
      version entered service in October 2002 as the -400ERF freighter and the
      -400ER passenger version the following month. Several 747-400 aircraft
      have undergone freighter conversion or other modifications to serve as
      transports of heads of state, YAL-1 laser testbed, engine testbed or the
      Cosmic Girl air launcher. The Dreamlifter is an outsize cargo conversion
      designed to move Dreamliner components. With 694 delivered over the course
      of 20 years from 1989 to 2009,[3] it was the best-selling 747 variant. Its
      closest competitors were the smaller McDonnell Douglas MD-11 trijet and
      Airbus A340 quadjet. It has been superseded by the stretched and improved
      Boeing 747-8, introduced in October 2011. In the late 2010s, older 747-400
      passenger aircraft were being phased out by airlines in favor of
      long-range, wide-body twinjet aircraft, such as the Boeing 777 and Airbus
      A350

      The wing is similar to previous variants, extended and with winglets
      Triple-slotted trailing edge flaps The 747-400's airframe features
      extended and lighter wings than the previous 747s, capped by winglets. The
      winglets result in a 3 percent increase in long-range cruise, improved
      takeoff performance, and higher cruise altitudes.The extended wingspan
      also gains an additional leading edge flap section. When unfurnished, the
      basic 747-400 fuselage is lighter than preceding models, but when fitted
      out it is heavier and stronger than previous models. The landing gear uses
      the same configuration as the previous 747s, but with carbon brakes
      replacing the previous steel ones, and overall weight savings of 1,800
      pounds (820 kg).The 747-400's glass cockpit features CRT displays which
      show flight instrumentation along with engine indication and crew alerting
      system (EICAS) diagnostics. The flight engineer station on the previous
      747s is no longer installed, and the new displays and simplified layout
      results in a two-thirds reduction of switches, lights, and gauges versus
      the Classic 747. Other new systems include an advanced Honeywell flight
      management computer (FMC) which assists pilots in calculating optimal
      altitudes and routes along with a Rockwell-Collins central maintenance
      computer (CMC) which automates troubleshooting tasks. The redesigned
      747-400 interior features new cabin sidewalls, heat-resistant phenolic
      glass and carbon composite paneling, and larger storage bins. An enhanced
      in-flight entertainment framework, called the Advanced Cabin
      Entertainment/Service System (ACESS), debuted on the 747-400, which
      integrates 18-channel audio capability, four-passenger intercom
      announcement zones, inter-cabin telephones, and passenger lighting into a
      central system. An eight-bunk overhead crew rest is installed above the
      aft cabin, while a second crew rest area is located on the upper deck
      behind the cockpit for flight crew use. The last few 747-400s delivered
      feature the Boeing Signature Interior, derived from the Boeing 777

      The Boeing 777, commonly referred to as the Triple Seven, is an American
      long-range wide-body airliner developed and manufactured by Boeing
      Commercial Airplanes. It is the world's largest twinjet. The 777 was
      designed to bridge the gap between Boeing's other wide body airplanes, the
      twin-engined 767 and quad-engined 747, and to replace older DC-10s and
      L-1011 trijets. Developed in consultation with eight major airlines, with
      a first meeting in January 1990, the program was launched in October, with
      an order from United Airlines. The prototype was rolled out in April 1994,
      and first flew in June. The 777 entered service with the launch customer,
      United Airlines, in June 1995. Longer range variants were launched in
      2000, and were first delivered in 2004. It can accommodate a ten–abreast
      seating layout and has a typical 3-class capacity of 301 to 368
      passengers, with a range of 5,240 to 8,555 nautical miles (9,700 to 15,840
      km). It is recognizable for its large-diameter turbofan engines, six
      wheels on each main landing gear, fully circular fuselage cross-section,
      and a blade-shaped tail cone. It is the first Boeing aircraft with
      fly-by-wire controls. It initially competed with the Airbus A340 and the
      McDonnell Douglas MD-11, both now out of production, and as of 2021
      competes with the Airbus A350 and A330-900. The original 777 with a
      maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 545,000–660,000 lb (247–299 t) was
      produced in two fuselage lengths: the initial -200 was followed by the
      extended-range 777-200ER in 1997; and the 33.25 ft (10.13 m) longer
      777-300 in 1998. Those 777 Classics were powered by 77,200–98,000 lbf
      (343–436 kN) General Electric GE90, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce
      Trent 800 engines.[8] The longer-range 777-300ER, with a MTOW of
      700,000–775,000 lb (318–352 t), entered service in 2004, the ultra
      long-range 777-200LR in 2006, and the 777F freighter in 2009. These long
      haul variants use 110,000–115,300 lbf (489–513 kN) GE90 engines and have
      extended raked wingtips. In November 2013, Boeing announced the 777X
      development with the -8 and -9 variants, both featuring composite wings
      with folding wingtips and General Electric GE9X engines. The 777 has been
      ordered and delivered more than any other wide-body airliner; as of
      September 2022, more than 60 customers had placed orders for 2,136
      aircraft of all variants, with 1,695 delivered. The most common and
      successful variant is the 777-300ER with 838 aircraft ordered and 832
      delivered. By March 2018, the 777 had become the most produced Boeing
      wide-body jet, overtaking the Boeing 747. As of 2018, Emirates was the
      largest operator, with 163 aircraft. As of September 2021, the 777 had
      been involved in 31 aviation accidents and incidents, including 8 hull
      losses (5 during flight and 3 on the ground) with 541 fatalities, and 3
      hijacks

      Three engine offerings are available with the Boeing 777; the General
      Electric GE90, the Rolls Royce Trent 800 and the Pratt and Whitney PW4000.
      The Triple Seven holds the record for the longest flight of a commercial
      airliner and is capable of flying more than halfway around the world.
